## 🚀 Key Features
- **Console Interface:** Simple and intuitive, allowing easy interaction via the terminal.
- **Move Management:** Alternates between players 'X' and 'O', recording chosen positions.
- **Win Condition Checking:** Automatically detects winning conditions by rows, columns, or diagonals.
- **Draw Detection:** Recognizes when all positions are filled without a winner.
- **Ease of Use:** Minimalist design, ideal for quick entertainment and learning purposes.

## 💡 How It Works
- **Board Initialization:**
    - The game starts with an empty 3x3 board, represented by blank spaces.
- **Player Alternation:**
    - Two players take turns, choosing positions on the board by entering row and column coordinates.
- **Move Registration:**
    - After each move, the board is updated and displayed in the console.
- **Win Condition Verification:**
    - After each move, the game checks if the current player has completed a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol.
- **Draw Detection:**
    - If all positions are filled without any player winning, the game declares a draw.
- **Game Termination:**
    - The game ends when a player wins or a draw occurs, displaying the corresponding message.
 
## 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used
- **Java:** A robust and widely-used programming language, ideal for building console applications.
- **IDE (Optional):** Integrated Development Environment for writing and debugging Java code.
- **Git:** Version control system for managing and collaborating on the project.

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher:** Required to compile and run Java applications.
- **Git:** (Optional) For cloning the repository.

## 📝 Installation Instructions
### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/esperanca-leonardo/tic-tac-toe.git
```
### 2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd tic-tac-toe
```

### 3. Compile the project
Ensure you have the JDK installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
javac App.java
```
This command compiles the App.java file and generates the App.class bytecode file.

### 4. Run the application
After successful compilation, run the application using:
```bash
java App
```
The application will attempt to solve the predefined Sudoku puzzle and display the result in the console.


## 📌 Observations
- **Board Customization:** To start with a different configuration, modify the board array in the App class.
- **Input Validation:** Currently, the game prompts for numerical inputs for row and column. Ensure to enter values between 0 and 2 to avoid invalid moves.
- **Extensibility:** Although currently a console application, the game can be extended with a graphical user interface (GUI) or additional features as needed.
